# PyBite
The ultimate tool for your python script compiling! Quick and easy, made with passion by PatzEdi.
### **A script that allows you to compile any python script in an automated, simple, quick, and easy way!.**
____________________________________________________________________________

This script uses py_compile, a Python library used to compile py files![Documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/py_compile.html)

Written in python, this script automates the need to compile python files yourself and makes you save time!
____________________________________________________________________________
## **Features**
- Set any custom directory to where the Python file is.
- Bites the file and makes sure that the file is actually a python file.
- Automatically moves the bite coded file from pycache folder to PyBite folder.
- Changes the file extension name from ".pyc" to ".py" in order to make it executable by python.
- Once you bite a file, you can input "00" to go back and bite another file, and do everything again!
- All in one go!
____________________________________________________________________________
## **Why?**
- I wanted to showcase how one can easily create a simple script like this one in order to save time in doing their job.
____________________________________________________________________________
## **How?**
- Creating a simple menu, the user can esaily create a compiled file through the use of [py_compile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/py_compile.html)
____________________________________________________________________________
## **User notice**
- Please note that once the py_compile library is updated, the script needs to be updated as well. New releases and commits will be made for this reason.

## **Thank you.**
This was a fun little project demonstrating the power of python and integrating it into a script that compiles its own language ;) Be sure to leave a star and follow the Twitter!
